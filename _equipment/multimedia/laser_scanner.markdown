> 2. This equipment may also not leave Curtin's campus at any time. 
> 3. When using the laser scanner, the user and if people are being scanned must wear protective goggles provided with the scanner. This is due to the scanner using a class-1 laser.
> 4. If people are being scanned, the person being scanned must be at least 1 meter away from the scanner at all times. 
> 5. Downloading outcomes of the scans require the software, "Artec Studio 15" which is only availble within the DBE Makerspace. Refining scans in this software can be done by a technician.
