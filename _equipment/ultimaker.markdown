{: .mb-7 .mt-3}

(FDM) Fused Deposition Modelling printing technology. For printing 3D models into physical objects. This is available for all students of DBE to print 3D models. Models needing to be printed need to be sent to the technicians. To print a model, please email or come to the Makerspace for further information.

## Setting up your Files

### Check for modelling errors

Common issues with 3D printing occur due to bad geometry, please make sure you check you meshes for the following before handing it to the technician team:

| Error Type | What this is?              | What does it causes?            | How do you fix it?              |
|:-|:---------------------------|:--------------------------------|:--------------------------------|
| **Non Manifold Geometry**  |  When an objects has edges that are not totally connected or objects with added faces. The object does not have volume. | Doing this causes some or all of the model to have no volume making it impossible to print. | Geometry must be fully enclosed, and only 2 faces may share an edge.
| **Non Unified Faces**      | 1                         | Doing this cases printing software to not understand what is inside or outside the model leading to unexpected results.                  | 10                          |
| **Support Issues**      | 10                          |
